# libradio - an AVR library for 434MHz communications

This repo has the source code (and Makefile) to build a master/slave
radio communications system based on the Si4463 radio.
The code is designed to work with the Kalopa Robotics microcontroller
board which features an Atmel ATMega328P CPU and a Si4463 radio
module.
The Si4463 is quite a complicated radio and requires a lot of setup
and hand-holding.
But it is an amazing transceiver with a wide range of functions and
abilities.

The entire system uses multiple channels within the 434MHz frequency
range.
