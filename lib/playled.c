 * ABSTRACT
 * The main library initialization code. The init call takes four bytes as
 * arguments. These represent the "world"-unique identification numbers
 * for the devices. They don't actually need to be globally unique,
 * just unique to your environment. The first two bytes represent
 * the category of device, whereas the last two represent the device
 * number. Sort of like the ClassID and the InstanceID. Define a taxonomy
 * for your environment, and assign the cat1 and cat2 bytes based on
 * that schema. Then number each unique device within each category,
 * so that no two devices ever have the same four-byte number.
